# User Experience 

# Strategy 

This website is for a Business to Consumer business that sells sports clothing, shoes and accessories. The target market for these products:

- Women & Men who enjoy sports and working out.
- Women & Men who enjoy accessorising their sport outfits.
- Women & Men aged between 18 and 50.

I believe the customers will need a website that is:

- Easy to Navigate and filter/search by category.

- Has the ability to view and purchase items.

- Has the ability to filter which gender the customer is.  

- User account functionality to store delivery information.

The owner will need a website that:

- Appealingly displays their products.

- Allows them to add, edit and remove products.

- Allows customers to get in contact if any issues arrise.
